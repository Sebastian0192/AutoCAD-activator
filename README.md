AutoCAD is a computer-aided design (CAD) software developed by Autodesk. It is widely used for drafting and designing in various fields, including architecture, engineering, and construction. AutoCAD enables users to create precise 2D and 3D drawings, blueprints, and models. The software provides a wide range of tools for drawing, editing, and annotating designs, including layers, dimensions, hatching, and more.

Key features of AutoCAD include:

2D Drafting: AutoCAD allows users to create detailed 2D drawings, such as floor plans, technical drawings, and schematics, with accurate measurements and annotations.

3D Modeling: It also supports 3D modeling, allowing users to create three-dimensional objects and render them with realistic lighting and textures.

Precision Tools: AutoCAD provides various tools for precise drawing and editing, such as snapping to grids, object tracking, and geometric constraints.

Customization: Users can customize AutoCAD to suit their workflow, including creating custom toolbars, commands, and scripts using AutoLISP or other programming languages.

Collaboration: AutoCAD supports cloud-based collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on the same design file simultaneously.

File Compatibility: AutoCAD supports various file formats, including DWG (its native file format), DXF, and PDF, making it easy to share and collaborate with others in different industries.

Rendering and Visualization: AutoCAD provides tools for creating high-quality renderings, walkthroughs, and visualizations of 3D models.
